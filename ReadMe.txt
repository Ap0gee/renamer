
  THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH THIS ADDON:
    Rename known or suspected NM placeholders.
    Create non standard NPCs on a private server and give your players a list file to name them.
    Rename Ken in Bastok Markets to something mean for having such a vile escort quest. Screw you Ken.  :)

  HOW TO USE THIS ADDON:

    First place the archive contents in your \Scripts\Addons\ directory.
    Now place a list file in \Scripts\Addons\renamer\lists\ or Edit an exiting list.

      /addon load renamer
    This will load the addon, but in an inactive state.

      /renamer load filename
    This loads the list of objects to rename from the specified file and activates the addon.
    To change to a different list simply input the command again using anotehr file name.

  TO AUTO LOAD:
    Place the above commands (both of them) in your default script for your ashita profile.

  OTHER COMMANDS:
      /renamer status
    Will display the currently loaded name list file, if any.

      /renamer stop
      /renamer unload
    Either of these will tell the addon to cease renaming objects.


  MORE TO BE ADDED AT A LATER DATE!
    Some future possibilities under consideration:
      Ability to add/remove lines from list file via addon commands.
      Some GUI elements as a command line alternative or as enhancements.
      Pet renaming. "Atomic Squirrel" Instead of "Carbuncle".
      Conditional naming. "Proto-Ultima (Energy Screen)"
      A cleaner/neater/simpler list file format.
